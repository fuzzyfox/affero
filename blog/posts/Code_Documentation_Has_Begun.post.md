Okay so I have finaly gotten to getting the code documentation happening. It can
all be found at [labs.mozhunt.com/affero/docs](http://labs.mozhunt.com/affero/docs).

The documentation is being automatically generated by phpdoc, and the main code
that is directly related to Affero can be found by clicking the small dropdown
in the top right corner.

Okay, so as it stands here is what is done:

 * The DAL now passes my testcase so yay! **BUT** I need to rewrite the testcase
 to account for my change in password hashing, and I could do with rewritting
 the DAL to utilise the more secure and up-to-date `mysqli` methods.
 * The utilities class has been started and so far passes all tests, however
 this class is likely to see future additions as I find more utility style
 function I need while coding.
 * I have an input class that provides me with some protection against xss
 attacks
 * I have the database structure in place and ready to get some test data into
 *(more to come on this soon)*

**Side note:** I thought I would share the Affero logo that was created before I
discovered a name clash with Affero GPL.... This is going to likely mean that
the project will soon be renamed however I will change the logo accordingly.
