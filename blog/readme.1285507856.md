Welcome to dBlog
================
Introduction
------------
**dBlog** is a markdown based, disposable blog. It uses only the most basic
of blogging features, and no database. All posts are saved as markdown files
which allows for easy reading as plain text as well as on this blog!

Features
--------
* Password Protected Create Post / Edit Post
* View Posts
* Simple Config
* Emoticons

### Emoticons
(:)) (&#58;)), (:D) (&#58;D), (XD) (<span>X</span>D), (}:D) (}&#58;D), (:P) (&#58;P), (;D) (&#59;D), (:3) (&#58;3), (:o) (&#58;o), (:() (&#58;()

Installation
------------
1. Upload and extract dBlog onto your server in the dir you want to run it.
2. Ensure that the `posts/` dir has read write permissions. You can do this from
the command line using

		$ chmod 766 posts/

3. Open `dblog.php` in your favourite code editor and change the configuration block.
4. Now you have done the hard part now... all you need to do is [create your first post](manage.php)
to get rid of this, rather boring message.
