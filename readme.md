Affero
======
Overview
--------
What is affero...? Well Affero is the latin for the word
“contribute”, and this is a fitting code name for this
webapp.

Affero is a community **contribution** wizard that is being
developed as part of an A-Level course. It aims to make
getting people involved in a community easier for those
trying to choose where in the community they want to help
out.

Where did the idea come from?
-----------------------------
Well the idea came from a Mr David W Boswell of the Mozilla
Foundation. He wanted to try to create a system whereby it
could be made easy for people to get started in the
community, and not have to trawl the 100+ websites in the
community, to find something they wanted to do.

As it stands this is a huge hurdle for most new contributors
to the Mozilla community. With lots of documentation on
many sites, it can all become a blur.

A note development
------------------
Right now the sole developer of this webapp is ofcourse
myself, and, due to restrictions by my exam board I cannot
get help from others (:(). Never fear however, you can
follow my progress on this project, fork the codebase, even
make your own changes! I just wont be able to add them to
my own work till after I have handed the final project over
to the examboard (not this one, but the offical
documentation) of the project.

How the project is being coded
------------------------------
This project is utilizing the **test driven development**
process, so there will be lots of tests before code appears.
Some will pass, others will fail, that is just how this is
meant to work. By the end of it all should pass and I can
get onto doing the best part of the job... working with you!

A little about myself
---------------------
So by now most of you reading this will know who I am, however
for those that do not I recommend you visit my site to learn
a little bit about the person writting you this awesome
little webapp. Visit [www.wduyck.com](http://www.wduyck.com/)
